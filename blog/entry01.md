## Choosing a topic 

The topic that I chose was Sports, and I chose it because it is a very intersting topic to talk about, not just for me, but it is a intersting topic for all of the world.and a topic like this in 2023 would of course have a great relationship between it and technology.it Start from using technology to watch your favorite sport to getting involved into the rules of the game. I learned a lot from googling ["the relationship between sports and technology"](https://us.humankinetics.com/blogs/excerpt/pushing-the-boundaries-of-technology-in-sport#:~:text=Now%2C%20new%20technologies%20are%20giving,of%20what%20sport%20even%20means.), ["how did the relationship between sports and technology evolve over time"](https://dailyhodl.com/2021/10/20/the-relationship-between-sports-and-tech-how-did-it-evolve-over-the-years/) and ["the impact of technology on sports "](https://itsupplychain.com/effects-of-technology-on-sports/#:~:text=Technology%20has%20made%20it%20possible,schedules%20to%20improve%20players'%20abilities.), because they helped me understan the effects of tecnholgy on sports and how the relationship devloped.
