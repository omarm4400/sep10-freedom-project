## Choosing a topic 

The topic that I chose was Sports, and I chose it because it is a very intersting topic to talk about, not just for me, but it is a intersting topic for all of the world.and a topic like this in 2023 would of course have a great relationship between it and technology.it Start from using technology to watch your favorite sport to getting involved into the rules of the game.I was thinking about chosing other topics like Computer Software and Airlines, but I decided to chose sports, because I use to play and watch soccer since I was very young, and I find it a very enjoyful topic to talk about as well as and reserching this topic. while resrching I found ["the relationship between sports and technology"](https://us.humankinetics.com/blogs/excerpt/pushing-the-boundaries-of-technology-in-sport#:~:text=Now%2C%20new%20technologies%20are%20giving,of%20what%20sport%20even%20means.), ["how did the relationship between sports and technology evolve over time"](https://dailyhodl.com/2021/10/20/the-relationship-between-sports-and-tech-how-did-it-evolve-over-the-years/) and ["the impact of technology on sports "](https://itsupplychain.com/effects-of-technology-on-sports/#:~:text=Technology%20has%20made%20it%20possible,schedules%20to%20improve%20players'%20abilities.), seeing all of these information about the relationship between sports and technology made the topic even more intersting to me,and made me want to learn about it more.
