## Elevator pitch takeaways:

During my elevator pitch I have faced a lot of challenges and these challenges provided me with some takeaways. One takeaway I had was practicing the prsintation, I was very frustriated before the elevator pitch because I thought that I won't be able to presint good and having strict judges made it worst, so I had to practice a lot before the elevator pitch so I can have a good presentation. Another takeaway was to be brave. During the elevator pitch there were a lot of students and only few of them wou;d come to you to look at your project, so I had to be brave and just stop people and ask them to see my project, and that helped me a lot because the students who saw my project gave me feedback and these feedbacks helped me in the presentation when the judges came. These were the takeaways I had from the elevator pitch.
## Class presentation takeaways:
During my Class presentation I also had a lot of similar challenges and takeawyas to the elevator pitch. One takeaway was also practicing the slides of the presintation but I had to practice it way more because it was a lot longer than the levator pitch and I had to share front of the whole class so it was so difficalt. Another takeaway was the prepration for the slide show. I used my notes to prepair for the slides and write down the things I am going to say and that helped me a lot because it helped me write down my thughts so I can do the slides faster.

# Skills:
During my presintations I've had grown a lot skilles, One skill I had grown was how to have good prperation. Prepration or practicing helped me a lot with my presintaton and doing it the write way will help you more because when you practice the presentation with people it's going to be easier on you when you acculy present front of others. Another skill that I've growm was asking people for help. If I didn't ask my friends with help in my presintation I would never have presented the way I did. So of course it's a very usful skill.
