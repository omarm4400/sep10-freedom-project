## Elevator pitch takeaways:

During my elevator pitch I have faced a lot of challenges and these challenges provided me with some takeaways. One takeaway I had was practicing the prsintation, I was very frustriated before the elevator pitch because I thought that I won't be able to presint good and having strict judges made it worst, so I had to practice a lot before the elevator pitch so I can have a good presentation. Another takeaway was to be brave. During the elevator pitch there were a lot of students and only few of them wou;d come to you to look at your project, so I had to be brave and just stop people and ask them to see my project, and that helped me a lot because the students who saw my project gave me feedback and these feedbacks helped me in the presentation when the judges came. These were the takeaways I had from the elevator pitch.
## Class presentation takeaways:
During my Class presentation I also had a lot of similar challenges and takeawyas to the elevator pitch. One takeaway was also practicing the slides of the presintation but I had to practice it way more because it was a lot longer than the levator pitch and I had to share front of the whole class so it was so difficalt. Another takeaway was the prepration for the slide show. I used my notes to prepair for the slides and write down the things I am going to say and that helped me a lot because it helped me write down my thughts so I can do the slides faster.
