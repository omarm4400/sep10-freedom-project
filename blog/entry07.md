## Elevator pitch takeaways:

During my elevator pitch, I have faced a lot of challenges, and these challenges have provided me with some takeaways. One takeaway I had was practicing the presentation. I was very frustrated before the elevator pitch because I thought that I wouldn't be able to present well, and having strict judges made it worse, so I had to practice a lot before the elevator pitch so I could have a good presentation. Another takeaway was to be brave. During the elevator pitch, there were a lot of students, and only a few of them would come to you to look at your project, so I had to be brave and just stop people and ask them to see my project, and that helped me a lot because the students who saw my project gave me feedback, and this feedback helped me in the presentation when the judges came. These were the takeaways I had from the elevator pitch.
## Class presentation takeaways:
During my class presentation, I also had a lot of similar challenges and takeaways to the elevator pitch. One takeaway was also practicing the slides of the presentation, but I had to practice it way more because it was a lot longer than the levator pitch and I had to share it in front of the whole class, so it was so difficult. Another takeaway was the preparation for the slide show. I used my notes to prepare for the slides and write down the things I was going to say, and that helped me a lot because it helped me write down my thoughts so I could do the slides faster.

During my presentation, I've used [My notes ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LMmkylA_xuVpdzjHb0oRsbM4Yx3c70EypvJGkC6xv3g/edit#heading=h.6o1f62qg6jz9) so I can write down the preparation for my presentation. And here is [my slide show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NfoDNkZOYw1XRO39RQjFp-yyW1_oc1qRyuYNA7rK4Fs/edit#slide=id.p) that I presented in front of the class.

# EDP:
I am currently in the 5th step of the EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is creating a prototype. Down here is a screenshot of my Afram, which is a prototype of the device that I want to see in the future. This divide is a screen at the edge of the field that helps referees make the correct calls for fouls!

# Skills:
During my presintations, I've grown a lot of skills. One skill I've grown is how to have good practice. Preparation or practicing helped me a lot with my presentation, and doing it the written way will help you more because when you practice the presentation with people, it's going to be easier on you when you successfully present in front of others. Another skill that I've developed is asking people for help. If I hadn't asked my friends for help with my presentation, I would never have presented the way I did. So, of course, it's a very useful skill.
