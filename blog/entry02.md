# Entry 2 Software and Hardware
##### 11/27/2023

## Software: 
Software and sports have a great relationship together because not only athlets use software in their games or training, but also sports' fans use software like apps to watch a match or check on the result of a game. And during my search, I found a lot of apps that deal with sports. For example, ["This website"](https://infostride.com/sports-apps/#:~:text=theScore%20is%20considered%20the%20%231,Bills%2C%20Cleveland%20Browns%20and%20more) has a lot of apps that fans use to watch sports or read news about the sport they like. ["This website"](https://slashdot.org/software/sports-management/) Â tells you a lot of different highly rated sports management softwares. This shows how software and sports have a great relationship together.

## Hardware:
Just like software, hardware also has a great relationship with sports. Because how else would the software not work without hardware? And during my search, I found more results for hardware than software because almost every athlete uses hardware like devices that help them in their training or other things. For example, ["This website"](https://www.cogniteq.com/blog/how-wearable-technology-changing-sports-industry#:~:text=Examples%20of%20wearable%20technology%20in%20sports,-Arguably%2C%20no%20other&text=Heart%20rate%20monitors%20track%20breathing,%2C%20quarterbacks%2C%20and%20other%20positions)tells you the benefit of the wearable divices that athletes use, and ["This website"](https://apacbusinessheadlines.com/10-Most-Innovative-Wearables-for-Fitness-and-Sport/) tells you a lot of wearable divices that athletes use that have a lot of benefits. This shows you how there is a great benefit between software, hardware, and sports.   

## Engineering Design Process:
I am now in the second step of EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is to research the problem. And according to my research on software and hardware, I see that there is a lot of improvement in technology in sports because a lot of different companies are seeing that a lot of people watch sports, so for that, they should invest more in sports so they can get more money at the end. So they make new machines using new technology, as you can see in the software and hardware divices and apps.

## Skills:

### How to Google:
During my blog entry, I learned a lot of skills, and for me, the most important one is learning how to search because that is what the main project is about. So learning how to search is a great thing because you need to master how to find what you are looking for so you can get the work done quickly and accurately.

### How to read:
Googling without knowing how to read and analyze what you are reading is nothing. It is because while googling, you will find a lot of results, and you should carefully read each result so you can get the answer you were looking for. So that is why you should read carefully and analyze what you're reading, because this skill that I learned during this blog helped me get work done faster.


### How to take notes:
After you google, read, and analyze what you read, you should learn how to take notes. While googling, you will see a lot of important results, but of course you will not be able to memorize all of them, so for that, you should take notes on all the important information that you see while googling because it helped me so much when pulling out the important information that I need.

## Summery:
Lastly this was one of the best tybe of searches I did so far because I love sports so much and I want to learn more about it.
