# Entry 2 Software and Hardware
##### 11/27/2023

## Software: 
Software and sports have a great relationship together, because not only athlets use Software in their games or traning also sports' fans use Software like appsm, to watch a match or to check on a result of a game. And during my search I found a lot of apps that deals with sports. For example ["This website"](https://infostride.com/sports-apps/#:~:text=theScore%20is%20considered%20the%20%231,Bills%2C%20Cleveland%20Browns%20and%20more) has a lot of apps that fans use to eather watch sports or to read news about the sport you like.["This website"](https://slashdot.org/software/sports-management/)  tells you a lot of different highly rated Sports Management Softwares. This shows how Software and sports have a great relationship together.

## Hardware:
Just like software, hardware also have a great relationship with sports. Because how else would the spoftware not work with out a hardware. And during my search I found more results for hard where than software because almost every athlet uses Hardware like divices that helps them in their traning or other things. For example ["This website"](https://www.cogniteq.com/blog/how-wearable-technology-changing-sports-industry#:~:text=Examples%20of%20wearable%20technology%20in%20sports,-Arguably%2C%20no%20other&text=Heart%20rate%20monitors%20track%20breathing,%2C%20quarterbacks%2C%20and%20other%20positions)tells you the benifit of the waerable divices that athlet use and, ["This website"](https://apacbusinessheadlines.com/10-Most-Innovative-Wearables-for-Fitness-and-Sport/) tells you a lot of divices waerable divices that athlet use that have a lot of benifits. This shows you how there is a great benifit between software,hardware and sports.   

## Engineering Design Process:
I am now in the second step of EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is to research the problem. And acording to my research on software and hardware I see that there is a lot of improvment in technology on sports because a lot of different companies are seeing that a lot of people watch sports so for that they should invest more in sports so they can get more money at the end. So they make new machines using new technology as you can see in the software and hardware divices and apps. 

## Skills:

### How to google:
During my blog entry I learned a lot of skills and for me the most important one is learning how to search because that is what the main project is about, so learning how to google is grat thing because you need to master how to find what your looking for so you can get the work done quickly and accurly.

### How to read:
Googlying without knowing how to read and analys what you are reading is nothing. It is because while googling you will find a lot of results and you should read carfully each result so you can get the answer you were looking for. So that is why you should read carfuly and analyize what you're reading because this skill that I learned during this blog helped me too much getting work done faster.


### How to take nots: After you google, read and analyze what you red you should learn how to take notes because while googling you will see a lot of importsnt results but of course you will not be able to memorize all of them so for that you should take nots on all the important information that you see while googling because it helped me so much when pulling out the important information that I need.

## Summery:
Lastly this was one of the best tybe of searches I did so far because I love sports so much and I want to learn more about it.
