# Entry 4 FB tool
##### 2/22/2024

## Choosing a tool:
Choosing a tool was very hard for me since there was a lot of new tools for me to use so I went through all of them and I chose Afram.
I chose Afram because I heard from my teacher that A lot of people have used it before and they found it easy for them.
so I tinkered with Afram and I tryed it out on replit and I made some stuff with it so I can get used to it. Also I chose Foundation and 
Bulma because they were in the medium level and they are similar to Afram. 
## More about the tool:
Afram is a web framework for building virtual reality and also you can develop Afram from a plain HTML file without having to install it on your combuter so you can try it when ever you want. Inside Afram you can build any shape you want and use these shapes to build characters. You can also create your own virtual reality world and install some images that you can add to your virtual reality world so it is a very fun program to use. 
## Sources:
The websites that I used to help me learn more about Afram and to try it out were [Afram.io](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/#what-is-a-frame).Which is the website for Afram the tells you what Afram is and tells you how to use it and set it up on your divice. And [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~) Which is the website you can use to try out Afram on and to build your own virtual reality world.
## Skills:
### How to choose properly:
Chosing your FB tool properly is the most important thing in this entry, so I had to choose it wisely and I tried doing that by going through all the tools and chose the choice that will match my leavel and will not make me regret my choice later on.
### How to tinker:
In order for me to conform my choice ofthe tool that I will use in my FB I had to accualy use the tool it self and tenker with it so I used Afram and I created a small virtual reality world for my self just to know how to work out Afram and to see if it was easy to use or not. And that has helped me so much becasue it made me get used to Afram so I can use it later on.

That is a picture of a snowman I created in Afram when I was trying it out.
