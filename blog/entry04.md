# Entry 4 FB tool
##### 2/22/2024

## Choosing a tool:
Choosing a tool was very hard for me since there were a lot of new tools for me to use, so I went through all of them and chose Afram.
I chose Afram because I heard from my teacher that a lot of people have used it before and they found it easy for them.
So I tinkered with Afram, and I tried it out on Replit, and I made some stuff with it so I could get used to it. Also, I chose Foundation and 
Bulma because they were at the medium level and they are similar to Afram. 
## More about the tool:
Afram is a web framework for building virtual reality, and you can also develop Afram from a plain HTML file without having to install it on your computer, so you can try it whenever you want. Inside Afram, you can build any shape you want and use these shapes to build characters. You can also create your own virtual reality world and install some images that you can add to your virtual reality world, so it is a very fun program to use. 
## Sources:
The websites that I used to help me learn more about Afram and to try it out were [Afram.io](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/#what-is-a-frame).Which is the website for Afram? It tells you what Afram is, how to use it, and how to set it up on your device. And [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~) which is the website you can use to try out Afram and  build your own virtual reality world.
## Skills:
### How to choose properly:
Chosing your FB tool properly is the most important thing in this entry, so I had to choose it wisely, and I tried doing that by going through all the tools and choosing the one that would match my preferences and not make me regret my choice later on.
### How to Tinker:
In order for me to conform my choice of the tool that I will use in my FB I had to actually use the tool itself and tinker with it, so I used Afram, and I created a small virtual reality world for myself just to know how to work out Afram and to see if it was easy to use or not. And that has helped me so much because it made me get used to Afram so I can use it later on.

That is a picture of a snowman I created in Afram when I was trying it out.
