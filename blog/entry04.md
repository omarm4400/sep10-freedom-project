# Entry 4 FB tool
##### 2/22/2024

## Choosing a tool:
Choosing a tool was very hard for me since there was a lot of new tools for me to use so I went through all of them and I chose Afram.
I chose Afram because I heard from my teacher that A lot of people have used it before and they found it easy for them.
so I tinkered with Afram and I tryed it out on replit and I made some stuff with it so I can get used to it. Also I chose Foundation and 
Bulma because they were in the medium level and they are similar to Afram. 
## More about the tool:
Afram is a web framework for building virtual reality and also you can develop Afram from a plain HTML file without having to install it on your combuter so you can try it when ever you want. Inside Afram you can build any shape you want and use these shapes to build characters
