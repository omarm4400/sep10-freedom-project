## Part B: 
Even though some people might think that sport is compleat, some people might think that it is not and i am one of them and i think that new invatation can make sport even more compleat without any mistackes, and that was what part B in my Freedom project is about new invatation that could help sport and the athleats that are playing it, because even though we are in 2023 there are a lot of new invatations every day so sport also should have some new invataion that effect it and the players to make the game more fun for fans to watch.  

## Sources:
Thinking of new invatation is a very hard thing to do,so i needed some inspiration from people who were already done with their freedom project.So i used ["This example"](https://alanl0566.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) and ["This example"](https://andyc6074.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/idea.html/)Which both had a lot of Possible Inventions that could happen in the future, and their topics were about baniking and medicen, which has the latest tencholgy on earth, so of course a topic like sport would have a lot more future inventions.  
## EDP:
I am now in the thired step of EDP (Engineering Design Process),which is Brainstorming the idea ans searching for posipole solution, and during my brainstorming I imagened some posiple inventions that could help sport and speachealy athleats. And the biggest one in my opinion was a machine that help players recover fast from ACL ribb, since it is the worset thing that could happen to an athlite so a machine like this will help a lot.      
## Skills: 

### How to brainstorm:
this whole part of the project was about brainstorming so of course i have grown my skill of brainstorming, because i haf  to think of new ideas for invations and i had to brain storm others' ivatation to come up with mine.   

### How to customize: 
A big part of this project was customizing my context, so i would have to grow up the skill of custumizing. custumizing helps with making the context you have easier for the reader to read and it makes your page looks organized and clean.
