## Part B: 
Even though some people might think that sport is complete, some people might think that it is not, and I am one of them, and I think that new invatation can make sport even more complete without any mistakes, and that is what Part B of my Freedom project is about: new lessons that could help sport and the athletes that are playing it, because even though we are in 2023, there are a lot of new invatations every day, so sport also should have some new invataion that effect it and the players to make the game more fun for fans to watch.

## Sources:
Thinking of a new invatation is a very hard thing to do,so I needed some inspiration from people who were already done with their freedom project. So I used ["This example"](https://alanl0566.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) and ["This example"](https://andyc6074.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/idea.html/)Both had a lot of possible inventions that could happen in the future, and their topics were about banishing and medicine, which has the latest technology on earth, so of course a topic like sports would have a lot more future inventions.
## EDP:
I am now in the third step of the EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is brainstorming the idea and searching for a positive solution, and during my brainstorming, I imagined some possible inventions that could help sports and especially athletes. And the biggest one, in my opinion, was a machine that helped players recover fast from ACL ribs, since it is the worst thing that could happen to an athlete, so a machine like this will help a lot.
## Skills:

### How to brainstorm:
This whole part of the project was about brainstorming, so of course I have grown in my skill of brainstorming because I had to think of new ideas for inventions and I had to brainstorm others' inventions to come up with mine.

### How to customize:
A big part of this project was customizing my context, so I would have to learn the skill of custuming. Curstuming helps make the context you have easier for the reader to read, and it makes your page look organized and clean.
