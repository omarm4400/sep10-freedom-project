## What I learned about my tool:
There is a lot of things I learned about my tool, and they're all helpful to use in my freedom project. Since Afram is all about shapes I had to learn all the shapes' Attributes. For example if I wanted to creat a box, I will need to know the value of the Attributes of hight which is 1, so I can edit it and chang in the shape of the box. Another thing I learned was the html arritbues I needed to use Afram and build codes. For example I need to use this arritbue
```html
 <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
```
to Use Afram and have the ability to use it's shapes.


## How I learned my tool:
I used a lot of stratigies and resurces to learn my tool, and they were all helpful to me. First I had to use [the main website for Afram ](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/#what-is-a-frame) to learn every thing about my tool. Because in this website I learned all the shapes' Attributes, but then that wasn't enough for me to learn all everything about my tool because I needed to learn how to actually use it so I used [This youtube chanel](https://youtube.com/@rennecastro8032?si=nV45a1pvMW_yD0pV) to learn how to use Afram.
