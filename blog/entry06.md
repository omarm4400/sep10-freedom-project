# How I made my MVP ?
Creating my MVP was one of the most exiting task I've ever did in my sep class because you get to express all of the skills you learned the whole year, like the tool I had to learn and all other types of codes. But it wasn't so easy for me, because it had a lot of challenges but after I went through these challenges I've benefited from them because of all the takeawys that I got.
## Challenges :
The challenges I faced during the process of ceating my MVP weren't that much, because they were thing I already went over this year. 
My first challenge was actuely remmempering all the things I learned in the begging of the year, so I had to use my notes for that so I can remmember all the old cods.
Another challenge I faced was editing the bootstrap templtes, when you downloded a bootstrap templte to use it you need to edit it, and edititing them is so hard because they have a lot of lines of code and they all represent defferent thing so you need to find the right line of code to edit, that s why edititng them was one of the hardest challenge for me.  
## Takeaways :
The takeaways that I got from the challenges I faced were very helpful because I can use these thakeaways later when I am doing beyond MVP. One of the most usfull Takeaway is using your notes more, a big part of creating my MVP was using my notes to remmper all the old codes that I needed. Another important takeaway was using " control F "> one of my biggest challenges was trying to find the correct code line so I can edit it and control F helped me so much with it because it makes you find the exact code line your looking for.
