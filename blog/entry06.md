# How I made my MVP ?
Creating my MVP was one of the most exciting tasks I've ever done in my SEP class because you get to express all of the skills you learned the whole year, like the tool I had to learn and all other types of codes. But it wasn't so easy for me because it had a lot of challenges, but after I went through these challenges, I've benefited from them because of all the lessons that I learned.

## Challenges :
The challenges I faced during the process of achieving my MVP weren't that many, because they were things I already went over this year. 
My first challenge was currently remembering all the things I learned in the beginning of the year, so I had to use my notes for that so I could remember all the old cods.
Another challenge I faced was editing the bootstrap templtes, when you downloded a bootstrap templte to use it you need to edit it, and edititing them is so hard because they have a lot of lines of code and they all represent defferent thing so you need to find the right line of code to edit, that s why edititng them was one of the hardest challenge for me.  
## Takeaways:
The takeaways that I got from the challenges I faced were very helpful because I can use these takeaways later when I am doing beyond MVP. One of the most useful takeaways is using your notes more. A big part of creating my MVP was using my notes to remember all the old codes that I needed. Another important takeaway was using "control F. "One of my biggest challenges was trying to find the correct code line so I could edit it, and control F helped me so much with it because it helped me find the exact code line I was looking for.

# Sources:
During my MVP, I've used a lot of different sources; for example, I've used [this website ](https://startbootstrap.com/themes) to download the bootstrap templates and use them as a theme to create my MVP. I also used [this webdite](https://replit.com/~) to try my tool and use it in my MVP. And lastly, I of course used [this webiste](https://github.com/) to create my MVP on it.


# EDP:
I am currently in the 4th step of the EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is to create a prototype. As you can see below, this is what I created using Afram, which is a prototype of the device that I want to invent in the future. And it's basically a technological device that helps the referees in soccer or any other sport spot a foul in the field that the referee might not see. This division already exists in soccer, but it makes a lot of mistakes, so that is why they need a newer version with fewer mistakes.

# Skills:
During the process of creating my MVP, I didn't learn that many skills because it didn't take that long, but I improved on some of the old ones.
* The first one that I improved on was how to take good notes. As I said before, my notes helped me a lot when I was creating my MVP, so this tells me that in the future I should take more notes and more helpful ones.
* My second skill that I improved on was listening properly. My second takeaway was a trick that my teacher taught me, which was to use control f to find the piece of code that I was looking for. So in the future, if I were to listen properly to my teacher, I would've learned more tricks.
