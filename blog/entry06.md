# How I made my MVP ?
Creating my MVP was one of the most exiting task I've ever did in my sep class because you get to express all of the skills you learned the whole year, like the tool I had to learn and all other types of codes. But it wasn't so easy for me, because it had a lot of challenges but after I went through these challenges I've benefited from them because of all the takeawys that I got.

## Challenges :
The challenges I faced during the process of ceating my MVP weren't that much, because they were thing I already went over this year. 
My first challenge was actuely remmempering all the things I learned in the begging of the year, so I had to use my notes for that so I can remmember all the old cods.
Another challenge I faced was editing the bootstrap templtes, when you downloded a bootstrap templte to use it you need to edit it, and edititing them is so hard because they have a lot of lines of code and they all represent defferent thing so you need to find the right line of code to edit, that s why edititng them was one of the hardest challenge for me.  
## Takeaways :
The takeaways that I got from the challenges I faced were very helpful because I can use these thakeaways later when I am doing beyond MVP. One of the most usfull Takeaway is using your notes more, a big part of creating my MVP was using my notes to remmper all the old codes that I needed. Another important takeaway was using " control F "> one of my biggest challenges was trying to find the correct code line so I can edit it and control F helped me so much with it because it makes you find the exact code line your looking for.

# Sources:
During my MVP I've used a lot of different sources, for example I've used [this website ](https://startbootstrap.com/themes) to download the bootstrap templeats and use it as a theme to creat my MVP. I also used [this webdite](https://replit.com/~) to try my tool and use it in my MVP. And lastly I oc curse used [this webiste](https://github.com/) to creat my MVP on it.


# EDP:
I am curintly in the 4th step of the EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is Create a prototype. As you can see below this is what I created using Afram which is a prototype of the divice that I want to be invented in the future. And it's bascily a tecnholgical divice that helps the refrees in soccer or any other sport to spot a foul in the gane that the refree might not see. This divice already excist in soccer but it makes a lot of mistakes so that is why they need a newer virstion whith less mistakes.

# Skills:
During the process of creating my MVP I didn't learn that many skills because it didn't take that long, but I improved on some of the old ones.
* The first one that I improved on was how to take good notes, as I said before my notes helped me a lot when I was creating my MVP so this tells me that in the future I should take more notes and more helpful ones.
* My second Skill that I improved on was listening properly. My second take away was a trick that my teacher taught me which was to use control f to find the piece of code that I am looking for. So in the future if I were to listen properly to my teacher I would've learned more tricks.
