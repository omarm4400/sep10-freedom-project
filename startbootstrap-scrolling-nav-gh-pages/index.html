                            This page will show you some websites that athletes and fans use, as well as some of the current inventions that deal with sports and future innovation.

                <li> An example of a wearable device that helps athletes is the Lumo Lift, which is a very helpful device that almost every athlete uses. It is a device that automatically straightens up your back so it doesn’t have a bad position when you grow up.    </li> <img src="image1.jpg" id="img">
                <li> The XMetrics Pro Swim Tracker helps swimmers by allowing them to focus on their swimming without being distracted by keeping track of timing and laps.

                        <li>    A device that helps with protecting the players from ACL.
                            The worst nightmare for players is when their ACL gets ripped, so a device that protects it will be very helpful.
                            A device that repairs the player's ACL would be great to speed up the recovery of the ACL. </li>

                            <li> A modified VAR device with no mistakes
                            The current VAR device has made a lot of mistakes, so they need to come up with a modified one. </li>

                            <li> A ball with some technology inside that tells us how fast the ball goes
                            Some players want to know their shooting power or the ball’s speed for personal records, so a device like that would be helpful.
                            A type of shirt that keeps players warm during the winter.</li>

                            <li> It will be very hard for players to play when it is cold, so they need some type of shirt that makes them warm.
                                medicine that helps players with recovery. </li>

                                <li> A lot of players get injured in games, and if they miss the other games, it will be bad for the teams.
                                A machine that makes ice evaporate.
                                Snow can make players struggle with their sports, so a machine that gets rid of snow fast will be helpful.

                                Sport Balls that don’t pop
                                I think this one is more for the fans, because a lot of people want to buy expensive balls, but sometimes they pop somehow, and you can’t buy more from them..
